Based on the information provided in the CSV file, here are some potential factors that might influence a property's value when determining whether it is a good investment or not. These factors could be used to create an algorithm for predicting properties with large lot sizes and high values.

1. `Lot Area`: This would likely be one of the most significant factors influencing property valuation, as larger lots typically result in higher property values due to their potential for increased returns over time.

2. `Assessed Land Value`: The value of a property's land could also be very important depending on its size and condition. 

3. `Assessed Improvement Value`: This would indicate the total improvement value, which can be an additional factor to consider when valuing properties. If there are significant improvements like a gym or playground on site, this could increase the overall value of property.

4. `Number of Bathrooms` and `Number of Bedrooms`: More bedrooms and bathrooms typically indicate larger homes with more potential room for upgrades or expansions, leading to higher values. 

5. `Year Property Built`: Older properties can sometimes provide protection against foreclosure threats, increasing their value.

6. `Construction Type`: This could also be important if it's an older house with modern finishes that were built in the earlier part of the year. Modern or ranch style homes are typically worth more than older styles due to their increased resale value.

7. `Lot Depth` and `Lot Frontage`: These factors could influence how large the lot is and its shape, which can affect property value. A wider and deeper lot might be worth more.

8. `Property Class Code`: Codes like VICI or VCIX show vacant land with restrictions which could be a disadvantage for real estate investment. 

9. `Status Code`: If the property is taxable, this factor may decrease value as property taxes can eat into home values.

10. `Assessor Neighborhood` and `Supervisor District`: These factors would provide contextual information about the neighborhood which might influence property values. A more residential area or a district with better infrastructure could result in higher property values. 

Please note that these are just potential factors based on the given dataset, actual real-world conditions can vary and may need to be explored further using other datasets or techniques such as time series analysis for changes over time, etc. Also, it is crucial to normalize data before building predictive models since different scales of features might have a disproportionate influence on model results. 

These factors could then all be used in an algorithm which would make predictions based on property value. The prediction model can help investors or realtors understand the market value and make decisions accordingly, for example by comparing predicted values with actual sales prices to determine under- or overpricing.
